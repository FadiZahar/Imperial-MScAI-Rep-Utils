# **Resource Repository for MSc AI Student Reps**

## 🧭 Overview

Welcome! This repository serves as a central hub of tools, templates, and tips for student representatives of the [*MSc in Artificial Intelligence*](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/prospective-students/courses/pg/mai/) at Imperial College London. 

It contains utilities, guides, and tips that could be useful for cohort support and activities. The goal is to help reps hit the ground running with resources collected and refined over time.

> 👉 Also check out this excellent [repo](https://github.com/harrygcoppock/ImperialMScAIUtils) from past students—it is packed with cheatsheets, book links, and other helpful utilities.

### 📋 Updating Exam A4 Sheets
When updating or adding new exam summary sheets in the `Exam A4 Sheets/` directory, please adhere to the following naming conventions to ensure consistency across the repository:

- **Naming Format:** Files should be named in the format `{Year}__ExamSheet_{ModuleName}__by_{FullName}.pdf`, where:
  - `{Year}` is replaced with the academic year (e.g., <code style="color : green">2023-2024</code>).
  - `{ModuleName}` is the specific module name abbreviation (e.g., <code style="color : green">DL</code> for Deep Learning).
  - `{FullName}` is the full name of the person who created or last updated the file (e.g., <code style="color : green">John_Doe</code>).

>This naming convention helps maintain a clear and organised repository and ensures proper credit is given to contributors for their work—matching the curriculum content relevant to the specified academic year.
