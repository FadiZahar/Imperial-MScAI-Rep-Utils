Note from the EdTech team:

Coursework assessment used to be done using a system called CATE,
this has now been replaced by a more modern system called Scientia
that is being developed by DoC staff and students.
Information about Scientia will be circulated early in the term.

Scientia documentation is available at the following URL:
